## Project Summary
With previous work into creating a scalable platform for UAS research resulting in the
ZyboCopter, we intend to push work further and create a small fleet of UAV platforms
that can be used for multi-agent research. Utilizing the flight controller system as
a starting point, our primary goal is to work towards a coordinated flight with multiple
UAVs under centralized control. We'll utilize this implementation as an opportunity to
continue revising the embedded flight controller as we plan to first migrate from the
prototype's Zybo FPGA to a more compact ZynqBerry FPGA board.
